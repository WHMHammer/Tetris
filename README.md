# Tetris

I started this project in order to pactice my skills in different languages.

## Python3

The first version I uploaded here is **not** the starting version already. I have modified the code for dozens of times even before I uploaded.

### Features

- Unix and Windows compatibility (Darwin is the the kernel of macOS)

- 3 levels of difficulty (can be easily modified to manually set the game speed)

- Show the next block

- Show current score

- One-button-to-pause/resume

- One-button-to-quit

- Store the highest scores in *tetris.db* under the same directory of *tetris.py*

### Goals

- GUI

### Bugs

(None as I know for now)

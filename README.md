# Tetris
I started this project in order to pactice my skills in different languages.
## Python3
The first version I uploaded here is **not** the starting version already. I have modified the code for dozens of times even before I uploaded.
### Features
- Darwin, Linux, and Windows compatibility (Darwin is the the kernel of macOS)
- 3 levels of difficulty (can be easily modified to manually set the game speed)
- Show the next block
- Show current score
- One-button-to-quit
- Store the highest scores in *tetrisHighScores.csv* under the directory of *tetris.py*
### Goals
- One-button-to-pause/resume
- GUI
### Bugs
(None as I know for now)
